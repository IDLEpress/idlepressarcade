# Gameplay Intros

## Tutorials
More complex games may require in-game tutorials. In general these are not required as typically arcade games are pretty simple or are designed so that player's need to spend a few quarters before they fully understand the gameplay.

- Not required, but a short module for learning controls
- Should be skippable
    - “Press Start Button to Skip”


## Printed Instructions
Instructions can be in the form of printed materials that can be added to the cabinet (eg. near the controls) and/or at the start of gameplay as a tutorial or in the attract mode.

## Story Intros (Cutscenes)
Should be skippable
- “Press Start Button to Skip"
