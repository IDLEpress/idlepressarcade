# High Scores
Ideally all games will have scoring mechanics that can be displayed in the UI.

- At game devs discretion, but this encourages repeat play

- Requires Leaderboard display overlay or Leaderboard title card

- Requires initials entry system (either three letter or ten).
    - Usually joystick sweeps through alphabet, any button confirms and moves to next digit entry
    - Should include letters, numbers, blank “ “, “End”, and delete/back

- High Score of the Day
    - Does not require leaderboard - just alerts someone that they have high score #1-3 and to enter initials.
    - Can be another title card on attract loop
