# Attract Mode

Attract mode is designed to grab potential player's attention and give a preview of the action.

When not in *active* gameplay, the game must alternate between displaying a Game Title card for 20 seconds and playing back an attract video or scripted sequence for at least 45 seconds. Length of times to be verified in field (VIF).

- Attract video may be a sizzle reel, gameplay demonstration (screen grab), leaderboard (if applicable), and intro cards (instructions/tutorials or story leads pulled from game).  Multiple different attract videos are a-ok.


## Game Title card 
- Include developer credits, publisher, etc.
- Include code version
- When whole credit is achieved the game should restart attract mode on title card, but can then proceed through usual attract mode assets.
