# Other Considerations

There should be no way for the user to quit the game.

The user should not have access to settings or other non-game specific areas.  The game menu is accessed via a button inside the coin door.

The utilites apps are accessed from the Terminal which is accessed by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T on a keyboard stashed inside the game.
